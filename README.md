### In this project we create a game that works by an algorithm that we build
### To guess the answer in the game in the smallest number of guesses.



## Main Departments:
### calculate:
An abstract class representing the voting player.
### Guesser:
An abstract class representing the player that must guess the numbers.
### SmartGuesser:
an abstract class representing the automatic player who can guess the number within 100 guesses at most.

## How the game works:
  ![Smart algorithm](https://archive.org/serve/msdos_MASTER_shareware/MASTER_screenshot.gif)
### You are given a code that you do not know.
### Step one :
You must guess the given code by entering numbers.
### Step Two:
After your guess you will get the following data:
### Bull - correct code, correct location.
### Pgia - Incorrect code, wrong location.
### 0 - No code entered.

## Functions:
 ### Play :
 The "Play" function returns the amount of rotations required for the player to guess the selected numbers.
 If he returns a number that is more then the maximum rounds you put, it means that the player automatically ends the game,
## calculateBull_And_Cows :
The Calculate.hpp file contains the "calculateBull_And_Cows" function that returns the amount of your "stamp".
 Which accept two string objects, a string of choice and a string of guesses, and return the string "bull and pgia".
